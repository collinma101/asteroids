| Earned | Points | **Ship/Player Character & Movement** |
| -----: | -----: | :----------------------------------- |
|     10 |     10 | Properly utilizes position, velocity, acceleration. Rotates left and right with arrow keys. |
|     10 |     10 | Acceleration (speeding up) and deceleration (slowing down) are gradual and obvious. |
|     15 |     15 | Accelerates with up-arrow. Decelerates upon no up-arrow. Ship stops or moves slowly when not accelerating. |
|     10 |     10 | Ship wraps around screen edges. |
|        |        | **Asteroid/Enemy & Movement** |
|     10 |     10 | Unique in individual appearance. |
|     14 |     14 | First-level asteroids break into 2 or more second-level asteroids. |
|      8 |      8 | First-level asteroids begin with random movement direction. |
|      4 |      8 | Second-level asteroids move in roughly same direction as parent, but with some variance. |
|        |        | **Weapon & Movement** | | |
|     10 |     10 | Space bar fires bullets in proper direction (based on ship heading) |
|     10 |     10 | Bullets are released with proper timing. (No unmitigated rapid-fire.) |
|        |        | **Collisions** | | |
|     10 |     10 | Test for ship-asteroid collisions is accurate. |
|     10 |     10 | Test for bullet-asteroid collisions is accurate. |
|     10 |     10 | Collision result is visibly evident. (ship-asteroid result in loss of ship/height) (bullet-asteroid result in smaller asteroids / destroyed asteroid) |
|        |        | **Gameplay & Interface** | | |
|     10 |     10 | Game is over after three ships are destroyed. |
|     10 |     10 | Ship lives are displayed on-screen. |
|     10 |     10 | Accurate score is displayed on-screen. |
|        |        | **Above & Beyond** | | |
|     20 |     20 | Your game includes something extra.  Itâ€™s obvious you spent time working on your extras.  Points are earned for demonstration of something new we have not learned in class, or a clear effort in adding extras to your game. |
|        |        | **Documentation** | | |
|     10 |     10 | Documentation.md file is complete and descriptive. |

Feedback:
- The movement feels really floaty - in a good way!
- (though, it does (eventually) go quite fast)
- second level asteroids often move in the opposite direction of their parent
- Above and Beyond list should also include: restart game and use of canvas
- EXCELLENT WORK!
- Because the .gitignore was added ::after:: the files were already versioned, they continue to be tracked. (case in point, open your project, run it, and then run `git status` to see all of the changes that the .gitignore would have ignored...)
